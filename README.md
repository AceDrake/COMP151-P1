# COMP151-P1

What I've done so far is create class files of different methods we need to fufill the project. Once we master each part, we
can integrate each class as methods to a main program or include them as a package and submit a program that runs through the
package. 

-System Requirements
Read a document of sorted ints. 
Delete repeated numbers.
Write new numbers to a new file. 
Document methods and sucessful runs

-System Goals

Timeline
